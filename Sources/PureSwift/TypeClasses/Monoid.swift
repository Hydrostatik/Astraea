/// The **Monoid** typeclass is a class for types which
/// have a single most natural operation for combining values,
/// together with a value which doesn't do anything when you combine
/// it with others (the *identity* element).
///
/// It is closely related to the **Foldable** typeclass.
///
/// **Monoid Laws**
///
/// * Operating a value with the identity should return the value exactly:
/// ```
/// x <> mempty = x
/// mempty <> x = x
/// ```
///
/// * The binary operation must be associative:
/// ```
/// (a <> b) <> c == a <> (b <> c)
/// ```
